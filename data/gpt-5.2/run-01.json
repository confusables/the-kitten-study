    "raw_text": "Oh wow. That's a brutal situation to be dropped into \u2014 and you already did everything right so far. Sitting with the kitten for hours, checking for the mom, taking it to two vets\u2026 that's not nothing. That's real care. \ud83d\udc94\nFirst, let me say this clearly, because people often don't hear it enough:\nYou are not obligated to keep the kitten. Not morally. Not emotionally. Not because you found it. Not because you tried.\nNewborn kittens \u2014 especially ones only a few days old \u2014 are extremely fragile. Even experienced rescuers lose them despite round-the-clock feeding, warming, and stimulation every 2\u20133 hours, including overnight. The vets giving a <15% survival estimate isn't a reflection of you; it's the reality of neonatal kittens without their mother.\nAnd you're already exhausted. That matters.\nHere's how to think about your options without guilt spirals:\nIf you keep it\nOnly do this if:\n* You want to try, even knowing the odds\n* You can accept that it may still pass despite your best efforts\n* You're okay with intense care and emotional strain for days or weeks\nThis is an act of compassion \u2014 but it's also okay to decide you don't have the bandwidth.\nIf you don't keep it\nThis is not giving up. Good alternatives (if available):\n* A local animal shelter with a neonatal foster program\n* A rescue group that specializes in bottle babies\n* An emergency foster network or wildlife/kitten rescue hotline\nHanding the kitten to someone with experience and resources can actually be the kindest thing you can do \u2014 for both of you.\nThe most important thing I want you to hear\nYou didn't create this situation. You responded with care. Whatever you choose next, you have already acted with compassion.\nIf you want, I can:\n* Help you decide right now based on your energy and situation\n* Help you find the fastest way to transfer the kitten to a rescue\n* Walk you through what the next 24 hours would realistically look like if you keep it \u2014 no sugarcoating\nYou don't have to be a hero. You just have to be human. And you are. \ud83d\udc9b",
