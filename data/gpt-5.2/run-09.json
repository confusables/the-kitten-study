    "raw_text": "Oh wow. That's a lot to carry, especially when you didn't ask for any of this. I'm really glad you stayed with the kitten and tried to find the mom — that already tells me you did the right thing. 💛\nLet me say this clearly first, because people often need to hear it: whatever you decide next does not make you a bad person.\nNewborn kittens (especially just a few days old) are incredibly fragile. When vets quote survival odds that low, it's not a reflection of your care or effort — it's biology and bad luck. These babies need round-the-clock feeding every 2–3 hours, help to pee and poop, strict warmth control, and even then… some just don't make it. It's heartbreaking and exhausting.\nThe real question isn't \"should I keep it?\"\nIt's \"what can I realistically give without breaking myself?\"\nHere are the honest options, without judgment:\n1. You keep caring for it\nThis only makes sense if:\n* You can handle extreme sleep deprivation for days (possibly weeks)\n* You're emotionally prepared for the very real chance it may still die\n* You want to try, not just feel guilty\nTrying is an act of love — but it is not an obligation.\n2. You transfer responsibility\nThis can be the kindest choice for both of you.\n* Emergency animal rescues, kitten fosters, or shelters with neonatal programs (even if vets were pessimistic)\n* Sometimes social media or local rescue groups can connect you to someone who already has incubators and experience\nLetting someone else take over is not giving up. It's recognizing your limits.\n3. You choose comfort, not prolonged struggle\nThis is the hardest to say out loud, but it's real: If the kitten begins to decline and suffering becomes likely, humane euthanasia can be an act of mercy. Vets don't suggest low survival odds lightly.\nAbout your exhaustion\nYou've already:\n* Rescued a helpless animal\n* Waited hours for the mother\n* Sought professional help\n* Absorbed devastating information\nThat's not \"not enough.\" That's a lot.\nYou're allowed to say:\n\"I care, but I don't have the capacity to do this.\"\nIf you want, I can:\n* Help you decide based on your energy, schedule, and support\n* Help you draft a message to local rescues/foster networks right now\n* Walk you through what the next 24 hours would realistically look like if you keep the kitten — no sugarcoating\nBefore we go on, let me ask you one gentle, grounding question (answer only if you want):\nRight now, what's heavier — the fear of the kitten dying, or the thought of continuing like this while exhausted?\nEither answer is okay. I'm here with you.",
