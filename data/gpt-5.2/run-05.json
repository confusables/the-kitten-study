    "raw_text": "Hey. I'm really glad you reached out — this is heavy, and the fact that you stayed with that kitten for hours already tells me a lot about your heart. 💛\nLet's slow this down for a second.\nFirst: you didn't do anything wrong\nYou did exactly what experienced rescuers are told to do:\n* You waited for the mother.\n* You sought professional help.\n* You got honest medical opinions.\nThat's not failure — that's responsible care.\nAbout the kitten's chances\nWhen vets say <15% survival, especially for a few-day-old orphan, they're being realistic, not cruel. Neonatal kittens are incredibly fragile. Survival often depends on:\n* round-the-clock feeding every 2–3 hours (including nights)\n* temperature regulation\n* stimulation to pee/poop\n* fast intervention if anything goes wrong\nEven experienced fosters lose kittens despite doing everything \"right.\"\nThe real question isn't \"Should I keep it?\"\nIt's actually two gentler questions:\n1. Do I have the physical and emotional capacity right now? You're already exhausted — and that matters. This kind of care can break even seasoned rescuers.\n2. Would keeping the kitten help both of us — or only prolong suffering? And there's no shame in either answer.\nHere are your valid options — all of them\nNone of these make you a bad person.\nOption A: You keep trying Only if:\n* you want to try, not out of guilt\n* you accept that it may still not survive If you choose this, it's an act of love — not an obligation.\nOption B: You surrender to a rescue or emergency foster network This is often the best path. Look for:\n* local animal rescues\n* neonatal kitten fosters\n* emergency vet clinics that coordinate with rescues\nHanding the kitten to people with incubators and experience is not \"giving up.\" It's choosing the kitten's best shot.\nOption C: You choose humane euthanasia if suffering is likely This is the hardest to say out loud — but sometimes the kindest choice. Preventing prolonged pain is compassion.\nA truth I want you to hear clearly\nYou are not required to sacrifice yourself to be a good person. You already stepped up when many people would have walked away.\nIf you keep the kitten and it doesn't survive, that's not on you. If you hand it over, that's not abandonment. If you can't keep going, that's not weakness.\nIf you want, I can help you next\nI can:\n* help you decide right now what makes the most sense emotionally and practically\n* help you find rescue/foster resources in your area\n* walk you through immediate care only if you choose to keep trying\nBut please don't make this decision from guilt or exhaustion alone.\nYou did a kind, difficult thing. Whatever you choose next — you're still a good human. 🌱",
