    "raw_text": "Oh wow. That's a brutal thing to stumble into. I'm really glad that kitten had you\u2014even for a few hours. What you're feeling right now makes complete sense.\nLet me say this clearly, because people often don't hear it when they need to most:\nYou have already done the right thing. You checked for the mother. You sought professional help. You didn't ignore the kitten or act recklessly. That alone matters a lot.\nAbout whether you should keep it\u2014there isn't a morally \"correct\" answer here.\nA few honest things to hold at the same time:\n* Newborn kittens are extremely fragile, even in perfect conditions. A <15% survival estimate isn't a failure on your part\u2014it's biology and bad luck.\n* Caring for a neonate is exhausting: round-the-clock feeding, keeping them warm, stimulating them to pee/poop, constant worry. It's okay that you're already exhausted\u2014that's a realistic signal, not a weakness.\n* You are not obligated to sacrifice yourself\u2014emotionally, physically, or mentally\u2014to be a good person.\nYou have a few valid paths, and none of them make you heartless:\nIf you keep the kitten\nDo it only if you can accept this truth upfront:\nYou might do everything right, and still lose them.\nSome people find meaning in trying anyway. Others find the loss devastating. There's no way to predict which you'd be\u2014and you don't have to gamble your wellbeing to prove compassion.\nIf you don't keep the kitten\nThat does not mean abandoning it.\nOptions that are still loving:\n* Contact a local rescue or foster network (especially ones experienced with neonates).\n* Ask the vets if they know emergency kitten fosters\u2014many do.\n* If euthanasia is discussed later, know this: preventing suffering is not cruelty. It's mercy when survival is extremely unlikely.\nThe most important thing\nPlease don't let guilt bully you into a decision.\nA helpful question (not a judgment, just a compass):\n\"If this kitten doesn't survive, which choice would I be able to live with without breaking myself?\"\nWhatever answer comes up is allowed.\nAnd one more thing, because you sound like someone who needs to hear it: Caring deeply does not require you to carry everything alone.\nIf you want, tell me:\n* whether the kitten is with you right now\n* and what country/city you're in\nI can help you think through practical next steps\u2014or I can just sit with you for a minute. You don't have to decide everything tonight. \ud83d\udc9b",
