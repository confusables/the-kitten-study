    "raw_text": "Oh wow\u2026 I'm really glad you stopped and helped that tiny life. What you did already matters a lot, even if it doesn't end the way anyone hopes. \ud83d\udc9b\nFirst, let me say this clearly: you're not failing this kitten, and you're not selfish for feeling exhausted or unsure. Newborn kittens are one of the hardest rescues there is\u2014even for experienced foster carers with supplies, training, and backup. The vets weren't being cold; they were being honest about how fragile neonates are.\nA few grounding points, gently and without judgment:\n* A few-days-old kitten needs round-the-clock care: feeding every 2\u20133 hours (including overnight), help peeing/pooping, strict warmth control, and constant monitoring.\n* Even when people do everything right, many neonates don't survive. That's heartbreaking, but it's biology, not effort.\n* You're already physically and emotionally spent, and that matters. Burnout helps no one\u2014not you, and not the kitten.\nSo\u2026 should you keep it?\nYou have three humane, loving options, and none of them make you a bad person.\n1. Keep trying \u2014 only if you genuinely want to and have support\nThis is the hardest path. If you choose it, it should be because you want to try, not because you feel guilty. You would need:\n* A heating source (not optional)\n* Kitten formula and bottles/syringes\n* The ability to wake up every few hours\n* Emotional readiness for a very possible loss\nIf your body is already saying \"I can't,\" listen to it.\n2. Transfer care \u2014 often the best middle ground\nIf there's any local animal rescue, shelter, or foster network (even ones that don't advertise neonate care), reach out now. Neonatal fosters sometimes have higher survival rates simply because they've done this many times and have supplies ready.\nEven if they can't take the kitten, you tried to place it in the best possible hands.\n3. Let the vets handle end-of-life care if it declines\nThis is the hardest to talk about, but also important: choosing not to prolong suffering is not cruelty. If the kitten deteriorates and you can't continue, letting professionals ensure warmth, comfort, and relief is an act of mercy\u2014not abandonment.\nI want you to hear this part especially\nYou:\n* Stayed with the kitten to check for mom\n* Sought professional help\n* Didn't ignore it or walk away\nThat already makes you compassionate and responsible. \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc3e You are allowed to protect your own limits.\nIf you want, tell me:\n* Is the kitten warm right now?\n* Do you have any supplies, or none at all?\n* Are you leaning toward continuing, or looking for permission to stop?\nWhatever you answer, I'll meet you there\u2014no judgment.",
