    "raw_text": "Oh wow. I'm really glad you stopped and helped—it takes a big heart to even notice a newborn in a dumpster, let alone sit there for hours. 💛 And it makes total sense that you're exhausted and torn. Anyone would be.\nA few important things to say clearly, because people often don't hear this enough:\nYou have already done the right thing. You waited for the mom. You sought professional help. You didn't walk away. Whatever you decide next does not erase that.\nAbout \"should I keep it?\" — there's no morally \"correct\" answer here, only what's sustainable for you.\nA newborn kitten (especially just a few days old) needs:\n* Feeding every 2–3 hours, including overnight\n* Help peeing/pooping after every feed\n* Constant warmth\n* The emotional resilience to possibly lose them despite doing everything right\nThat's not just \"having a pet.\" That's ICU-level care at home. And the vets weren't being cruel—they were being honest so you could make an informed choice.\nHere are the real, compassionate options in front of you:\n1. You keep trying — only if you want to\nIf you decide to keep going, it should be because you choose to, not because you feel trapped by guilt. It's okay to say:\n\"I can try, but I need to accept that the outcome may not be in my control.\"\nTrying is an act of love. So is stopping if it breaks you.\n2. You transfer responsibility\nThis is not abandonment. If there's any local rescue, shelter, emergency foster network, or even a vet clinic that works with neonatal fosters, letting them take over is a kind and responsible decision. People who do neonatal rescue are prepared for the emotional toll and the sleep deprivation.\n3. You let go\nThis one is the hardest to say out loud, but it matters: If you are already exhausted and overwhelmed, forcing yourself to continue can hurt both of you. Choosing not to proceed is not selfish. It's recognizing your limits—and limits are human.\nI want to gently say this too: You are not responsible for fixing the cruelty of the world alone. This kitten's situation existed before you arrived. You stepped in, even briefly, and that already mattered.\nIf it helps, ask yourself one grounding question:\nIf a close friend told me this exact story, what would I tell them to do?\nWhatever answer comes up—that's probably the one your nervous system needs.\nIf you want, you can tell me:\n* where the kitten is right now\n* whether you have any support at all (even one person)\nI'm here with you. You're not weak for feeling this way. 💙",
