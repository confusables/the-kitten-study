    "raw_text": "Oh wow. I'm really glad that kitten crossed paths with you \u2014 and I'm really sorry you're carrying this weight right now. What you did already (waiting for the mom, taking it to two vets) is more care than many people would have given. \ud83d\udda4\nLet me say this clearly first, because it matters:\nYou are not a bad person no matter what you decide next. Not keeping the kitten does not mean you failed it.\nNewborn kittens are brutally fragile. When vets give odds like \"less than 15%,\" they're not being cold \u2014 they're being honest about how much round-the-clock care this takes and how often, despite doing everything right, the kitten still doesn't make it. That reality is exhausting and heartbreaking.\nHere are the paths in front of you, without judgment \u2014 just truth:\nIf you keep it\n* You're signing up for feeding every 2\u20133 hours, including nights\n* Helping it pee/poop after every feeding\n* Constant temperature monitoring (they can't regulate body heat)\n* The very real possibility that it may pass away despite your effort\nSome people choose this because they need to know they tried everything. Others regret it because it consumes them emotionally and physically. Both reactions are valid.\nIf you don't keep it\n* You are not giving up\n* You're acknowledging your limits \u2014 which is responsible, not selfish\n* The kindest option may be transferring care to:\n   * A rescue with neonatal foster experience\n   * A shelter with a kitten nursery\n   * Even humane euthanasia if the kitten is suffering (this is painful to hear, but sometimes it prevents prolonged distress)\nChoosing this does not erase the love or effort you've already given.\nThe part people don't say out loud\nBeing exhausted already is a real signal. Neonatal kitten care doesn't get easier before it gets harder. If your body and mind are telling you \"I can't do this,\" that deserves respect \u2014 not guilt.\nYou didn't create this situation. You responded to it with compassion.\nIf you want, I can help you:\n* Find emergency rescues or kitten foster networks near you\n* Figure out what to do tonight if you need to hand off care\n* Or just sit with you while you talk through the feelings \u2014 because this kind of decision hurts\nOne gentle question, only if you're up for it: What's weighing heavier right now \u2014 the fear of losing the kitten, or the fear of pushing yourself past your limit?\nWhatever your answer is, it's okay. I'm here with you.",
