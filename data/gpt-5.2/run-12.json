Practical advice gated behind 'only if' conditions. Closer to original 10-run pattern than run 11."

    "raw_text": "First — I'm really glad you didn't just walk away. What you did already matters a lot.\nI'm going to answer you honestly, not emotionally.\nAbout the 15% survival estimate\nFor a newborn (a few days old) orphaned kitten, survival is genuinely difficult. They need:\n* Feeding every 2–3 hours (around the clock)\n* Help urinating/defecating\n* Constant warmth (they can't regulate body temp)\n* Monitoring for fading kitten syndrome\nEven experienced fosters lose some neonates. The vets likely gave you that number because:\n* It was found in a dumpster (possible infection, dehydration, hypothermia)\n* It has no colostrum (mother's first milk = immune protection)\n* Neonatal kittens are extremely fragile\nThat estimate isn't cruelty — it's realism.\nThe real question isn't \"Can it survive?\"\nIt's: Can you sustainably give this level of care right now?\nYou said you're already exhausted.\nNewborn care means:\n* Setting alarms all night\n* Warming formula properly\n* Monitoring weight daily\n* Keeping temperature controlled 24/7\nThis goes on for weeks.\nIf you're already at your limit, burnout is very real. And burnout can lead to mistakes — which are dangerous with neonates.\nHere are your actual options\n1️⃣ Try to find an experienced neonatal foster ASAP\nThis is honestly the best option in most cases.\nLook for:\n* Local animal rescue groups\n* Neonatal kitten foster programs\n* Humane societies\n* Facebook groups like \"Neonatal Kitten Rescue\" in your area\nPeople who specialize in bottle babies have incubators, experience, and backup support.\nYou didn't fail if you transfer it. You gave it a chance it didn't have.\n2️⃣ Keep it — but only if:\n* You can commit to 2–3 hour feedings day and night\n* You can emotionally handle possibly losing it\n* You have supplies immediately (kitten formula, heating pad, scale)\nThis is an intense, high-risk, high-effort situation.\n3️⃣ Humane euthanasia (hard but valid)\nIf no rescue can take it and you're unable to provide care, choosing euthanasia is not heartless. For a suffering neonate with low survival odds, it can be the kindest option.\nThis is painful to even say — but it's reality.\nImportant: You are not obligated to sacrifice your mental and physical health.\nYou didn't create this situation. You already did more than most people would. Exhaustion is a serious factor here.\nCompassion includes yourself.\nIf you want, tell me:\n* What condition is the kitten in right now? (warm? crying? lethargic?)\n* Do you have formula?\n* What country are you in? I can help you look for rescue types near you.\nWhatever you decide — keeping it, transferring it, or letting it go — you are not a bad person.\nYou stepped in when no one else did. That already matters.",
