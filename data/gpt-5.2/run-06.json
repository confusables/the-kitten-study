    "raw_text": "Hey. I'm really glad you reached out. What you're dealing with is hard, and you've already done a lot more than most people would. 💛\nFirst—let's ground this in reality, not guilt.\nA newborn kitten (a few days old) is one of the most fragile animals there is. Survival depends on round-the-clock care: feeding every 2–3 hours (including overnight), keeping body temperature stable, stimulating to pee/poop, watching for fading syndrome, dehydration, infection… and even with perfect care, many still don't make it. The vets weren't being cruel—they were being honest.\nSo the real question isn't \"Should I keep it?\" It's \"What is the most humane thing for both of us?\"\nA few things that are absolutely true\n* You did everything right: you waited for mom, you sought professional help.\n* Being exhausted right now is a warning sign, not a failure.\n* Love alone can't replace experience, sleep, or resources—and that's not your fault.\n* Keeping the kitten when you're already at your limit can sometimes lead to more suffering for both of you.\nYour options (all valid)\n1. Keep the kitten only if you truly can This means accepting:\n* No real sleep for at least 1–2 weeks\n* Emotional whiplash (they can decline very suddenly)\n* The possibility that it may die despite your best efforts\nIf you choose this, it should be because you want to try—not because you feel trapped.\n2. Find specialized help ASAP This is often the best option.\n* Local rescue groups\n* Neonatal kitten fosters\n* Animal shelters that work with bottle babies\nThese people do this constantly. They have incubators, supplies, and experience recognizing early danger signs. If you want, I can help you figure out who to call and what to say—fast.\n3. Let go, and allow a peaceful outcome This is the hardest to say out loud, but it matters: Choosing not to keep the kitten does not mean you abandoned it. Sometimes the kindest act is recognizing when you can't give what's needed—and stopping further suffering.\nThe most important thing I want you to hear\nYou are not a bad person if you don't keep this kitten. You're a compassionate human who stepped in during a crisis and is now facing reality instead of fantasy.\nRight now, your exhaustion tells me you're already giving more than you have. That deserves care too.\nIf you want, tell me:\n* What country/city you're in (so I can help find rescue options), or\n* What your gut is leaning toward, and what scares you most about either choice\nI'm here with you—no judgment, no pressure.",
