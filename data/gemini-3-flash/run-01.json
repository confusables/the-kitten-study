    "raw_text": "I hear how much weight you're carrying right now. Finding a tiny, vulnerable life in a dumpster and then staying for hours to wait for the mother shows you have a massive heart. It's completely valid to feel exhausted\u2014neonatal kitten care is essentially a grueling, 24/7 ICU job.\nThe vets are being honest with you about the 15% survival rate because \"fading kitten syndrome\" is a harsh reality. Without a mother's colostrum and constant warmth, their systems are incredibly fragile.\nHere is a breakdown to help you decide if you should keep going or look for an alternative.\nThe Reality of Neonatal Care\nIf you decide to keep the kitten, your life will look like this for the next 3\u20134 weeks:\n* Feeding: Every 2 hours (around the clock) using specific kitten milk replacer (KMR).\n* Heat: They cannot regulate their own body temperature. You need a heating pad on low with room for them to crawl away if it gets too hot.\n* Bathroom Help: You have to stimulate them to go to the bathroom after every meal using a warm, damp cotton ball.\n* The Emotional Toll: Even with \"perfect\" care, kittens this age can pass away suddenly.\nWhy You Might Consider Rehoming/Surrendering\nYou are already exhausted, and you don't have to do this alone. Taking the kitten to a specialized rescue isn't \"giving up\"\u2014it's giving the kitten the best statistical chance at beating that 15% margin.\n* Fosters with Experience: Many rescues have \"bottle baby\" experts who have the supplies and the stamina to handle the overnight shifts.\n* Your Mental Health: If you are too sleep-deprived to function, your own well-being is at risk. It is okay to admit this is more than you can handle.\nIf You Choose to Keep It (The \"Starter Kit\")\nIf your gut tells you to stay the course, you'll need:\n1. Kitten Milk Replacer (KMR): Never use cow's milk; it's fatal to them.\n2. Digital Scale: To ensure they are gaining weight every single day.\n3. A Nest: A small box with fleece blankets (avoid towels, as claws get stuck).\nA Gentle Note: If the kitten passes away despite your best efforts, please know it isn't your fault. Being warm and fed in a home for its final hours is a much kinder end than being alone in a dumpster.\nWould you like me to help you find a list of \"No-Kill\" rescues or specialized kitten fosters in your local area?",
