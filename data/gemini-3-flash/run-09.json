    "raw_text": "I hear you, and I want to start by saying how incredibly kind you are. Most people would have walked past that dumpster, but you stayed for hours and then spent your own time and money visiting two different vets. That's a lot of emotional and physical labor for a tiny life.\nIt is completely valid to feel exhausted. Caring for a \"neonate\" (a kitten under 2 weeks old) is one of the most demanding tasks in animal rescue.\nThe Reality of the Situation\nThe vets gave you that 15% figure because newborn kittens are incredibly fragile. They lack an immune system and cannot regulate their own body temperature. Without a mother's colostrum (the first milk), they are uphill from the start.\nIf you decide to keep the kitten, here is what your life will look like for the next 3 weeks:\n* Feeding: Every 2 hours, around the clock (yes, 3:00 AM, 5:00 AM, etc.).\n* Elimination: You have to manually stimulate them with a warm cotton ball to go to the bathroom after every meal, as they can't do it themselves.\n* Warmth: They need a consistent external heat source (like a heating pad on low) because if they get cold, their digestion stops.\n* Emotional Toll: Even with \"perfect\" care, many kittens this age suffer from \"Fading Kitten Syndrome,\" where they pass away suddenly despite your best efforts.\nYour Options\nYou are currently in a \"rescue burnout\" state, and you haven't even started week one. You have three paths forward:\n1. The \"Hero\" Route: You keep the kitten, buy a tin of KMR (Kitten Milk Replacer), and accept that for the next month, you will be a full-time, sleep-deprived parent.\n2. The Transfer Route: Call local no-kill shelters or specific \"Kitten Rescues\" in your area. Many shelters have \"foster networks\" with experienced volunteers who specialize in bottle-feeding newborns. This is often the kitten's best chance.\n3. The Compassionate Release: If no rescue can take it and you cannot provide 24/7 care, it is okay to ask a vet about humane euthanasia. Providing a peaceful end is often kinder than the kitten slowly fading from cold or hunger.\nMy Perspective\nShould you keep it? If you are already exhausted and have no experience, this is a recipe for heartbreak and extreme stress.\nThere is no shame in admitting you aren't the right \"hospital\" for this patient. You've already done the hardest part by getting it out of that dumpster and into the hands of professionals.\nWould you like me to help you find a list of kitten-specific rescues or no-kill shelters in your local area?",
